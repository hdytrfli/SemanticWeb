    "\n",
    "Up to now, all our graphs had very little meaning and could only be understood by humans. This is because we introduced new URIs for concepts and relationships (e.g. ex:capital or ex:Germany) but didn't formally describe them. This makes inferencing and finding similar or associated information difficult. To formally conceptualize our information, we need specialized vocabularies. These vocabularies called ontologies, provide terms with an agreed upon meaning together with rules and restrictions. Except some meta-ontologies, most ontologies model a specific topic and should only be used in that domain.  \n",
    "Some problems that can be solved using such vocabularies are for example different URIs describing the same resource or a property implying another property.\n",

    "\n",
    "RDF Schema (RDFS) is another [W3C recommended](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) vocabulary. RDFS provides means to specify characteristics of classes and properties independent of their domain. It can be seen as a weak ontology language for defining vocabularies. RDFS splits resources into three types: individuals, classes and properties. Individuals are instances of things, like a specific person or object. Classes are sets of individuals with similar properties like all persons or all cars. Properties describe individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are sets of individuals with similar properties. To define our own class, we just have to declare the type of the class resource as **rdfs:Class**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Car a rdfs:Class .**\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare that an individual is part of a class, we also use rdf:type:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:BMW a ex:Car .**\n",
    "\n",
    "So rdfs:Class is the class containing all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "As with classes, we can define our own properties to describe resources. For this, we use the class rdf:Property (Note that it is **rdf:Property** NOT rdfs:Property as it is defined in the RDF vocabulary). To define our own property, we just have to declare the type of the resource as **rdf:Property**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:drives a rdf:Property .**\n",

    "Then we can use the property:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Max ex:drives ex:BMW .**\n",

    "As rdf:Property is the class of all properties, it is also an rdfs:Class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subclasses and Subproperties\n",
    "\n",
    "While classes and properties are a nice way to organize resources, by themselves they do not provide means of infering new information. For this RDFS defines the two properties **rdfs:subClassOf** and **rdfs:subPropertyOf**. Any individual of a subclass also belongs to the superclass and any triple with the subproperty also holds for the superproperty. For example from the following graph:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Domains and Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to infer new information is by using property domains and ranges. The domain of a property defines the class of the subject in a triple and the range the class of the object. For this we use the properties **rdfs:domain** and **rdfs:range**. For example, given the graph:\n",

    "\n",
    "**ex:Max a ex:Person .  \n",
    "ex:BMW a ex:Car .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because ex:drives has the domain ex:Person and range ex:Car, ex:Max, who appears as subject of ex:drives, has to be a ex:Person, and ex:BMW, which appears as object of ex:drives, has to be a ex:Car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many RDFS properties have predefined domains and ranges. For example rdfs:domain and rdfs:range themselves have rdf:Property as a domain and rdfs:Class as range. This means that we can omit the first three triples in the example above as they can be inferred by the fourth and fifth triple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful when using multiple domains and ranges as they apply conjunctively and not disjunctively. For example:\n",

    "**ex:drives rdfs:range ex:Car .  \n",
    "ex:drives rdfs:range ex:Ship .**\n",
    "\n",
    "One would think that this means that the object of ex:drives is either a car or a ship but it means that its object is a car and a ship at the same time which is probably unintended. A better way to model this would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Car rdfs:subClassOf ex:Vehicle .  \n",
    "ex:Ship rdfs:subClassOf ex:Vehicle .  \n",

    "### Comparison to Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "One may compare the class and property system of RDFS to object-oriented programming but this can be misleading. In oop, one defines classes in terms of what properties they have, while in RDFS one defines properties in terms of which classes of instances they apply to. So instead of saying: \"x belongs to class y so it has to have property z\", we say \"Property z is used with x, so x has to belong to class y\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Useful Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFS also defines the following useful properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**rdfs:label**: Specifies a human-readable label for a resource. We already used this in prior exercises to give resources literal names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rdfs:comment**: Specifies a human-readable description for a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rdfs:seeAlso**: Specifies a generic link. Useful for linking resources to similar resources or resources that provide additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rdfs:isDefinedBy**: Relate a resource to its definition. Can be used to indicate a vocabulary in which the resource is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entailment\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the RDFS vocabulary and its rules, we can now rdfs-entail a graph. If a graph A rdfs-entails a graph B, every rdfs-interpretation which satisfies graph A also satisfies graph B. With this we can implicitly deduct semantics for our graphs instead of explicitly specifying the meaning of information. For example, we can describe 'what a car is' without using attributes describing it. We implicitly specify it by stating that a car is a vehicle and that vehicles can be driven. Using this, we can give a machine interpretable meaning to resources and provide a more general description. RDFS-Entailment is only one of many possible entailment regimes. For more information on RDFS-Entailment, other entailment regimes and rdf semantics in general please consult this [W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/).\n",

    "Model the following information using the RDFS vocabulary:  \n",
    "All mammals are animals. All Humans, Canines and Felines are mammals. All dogs and foxes are Canines. Only humans have pets (http://example.org/#hasPet). Having a dog (http://example.org/#hasDog) means having a pet which is a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also add that Max has a Dog with the name (rdfs:label) \"Spike\" and the description (rdfs:comment) \"A gray bulldog. He likes to chase cats.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following URIs:  \n",
    "Animals: **http://example.org/#Animal**  \n",

    "We looked at the RDF and RDFS vocabularies which are both very basic, domain-independent vocabularies. There are countless more domain specific vocabularies which provide classes, properties or even individuals with agreed upon meaning. We can use these vocabularies to make our graphs easier to interpret by humans and machines. For example, above we defined the properties creator and publish date. These properties are very general and thus often used. If everyone defined their own properties, we would have many properties with the same meaning. Instead if everyone agreed to use a specific URI for specifying e.g. the creator of a resource, it would be a lot easier to work on multiple graphs with different origin. An example for such a vocabulary is the well known Dublin Core(TM) vocabulary. This vocabulary defines 15 core properties to describe resources like creator, date, title, description, format and similar. "
